<h2><a name="queryFramework"></a>How to use the query framework</h2>
<p class="backto"><font size="-1">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</font></p>

<p>
The query framework provides the basic infrastructure for specifying and executing
queries against a set of EMF-Model elements and their contents. The following are the
main classes to be used when formulating query statements:
<ol>
<li>The <code>IEObjectSource</code> interface provides the search scope elements to be used in a query.</li>
<li>The <code>SELECT</code> class implements a template-function that does the iteration over model
elements and applies the search condition on each; it collects the resulting elements
into a <code>QueryResultSet</code> object and returns it to the caller.</li>
<li>The <code>FROM</code> class represents the elements to search. It is responsible of providing
an appropriate iterator for the elements in the search space.</li>
<li>The <code>WHERE</code> class applies the search conditions over the elements in the search set.</li>
<li>The <code>UPDATE</code> class passes the elements who satisfy the search condition to a caller-supplied
modification function. It collects the modified elements into a QueryResultSet object
and returns it to the caller.</li>
<li>The <code>QueryResultSet</code> class represents the set of elements returned by a given query.</li>
<li>The <code>EObjectCondition</code> class is the abstract parent of all conditions that deal with model-elements (i.e., EObjects).
It incorporates the services of a PruneHandler in order to answers whether or not to prune the element
tree at a specific element and thus ignore its children.</li> 
<li>The <code>ConditionPolicy</code> class is used to allow the user to decide how to apply a given condition
on a collection of a model-element <code>EAttributes</code> or <code>EReferences</code> values. Supports both the: exists (ANY) and
for-all (ALL) semantics.</li>
<li>The <code>EObjectStructuralFeatureValueCondition</code> class is the parent class for conditions that are responsible
for checking the values held in model-elements’ attributes or references. It uses the help of two other
condition objects. The first is an EObjectCondition that it used to decide on the validity of
context element (a context element is the model element whose attribute we are evaluating) and the other
condition is an evaluator Condition that it uses to evaluate the value held in the attribute or the reference
and whether or not it matches what the user is looking for</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Using the above classes follow the steps described below to create and execute queries.
<ol>
<li>Create an implementation of the <code>IEObjectSource</code> interface</li>
<li>Extend the <code>EObjectCondition</code> class to define custom conditions or use one of the pre-defined conditions
available as part of the query framework</li>
<li>Create a statement using the <code>SELECT</code> or <code>UPDATE</code> clauses</li>
<li>Execute the statement to produce the results</li>
<li>Check to ensure that the query did not generate any exceptions during its execution</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="clipboardFramework"></a>How to use the clipboard framework</h2>
<p class="backto"><font size="-1">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</font></p>

<p>
The clipboard framework allows the EMF meta-model providers to support copying EMF objects
to and pasting them from the system clipboard. The following are the
main extension points and classes to be used when providing clipboard support:

<ol>
<li>Extension point <a href="../../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_gmf_runtime_emf_clipboard_core_clipboardSupport.html">org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.clipboard.core.clipboardSupport</a> allows
extensions to implement fairly complex meta-model specific semantics for copy/paste operations, where some
relationships between model elements need special treatment</li>
<li>Providers register an implementation of the <code>IClipboardSupportFactory</code> interface for supporting clipboard
copy/paste operations on EMF models. The implementation is responsible for creating <code>IClipboardSupport</code>
for the packages on which it is registered</li>
<li>Clients can use the utility class <code>ClipboardUtil</code> for the creation of <code>IClipboardSupport</code> instances for
specific EMF meta-models and for copy/paste operations to and from a <code>String</code> form for use on the system clipboard</li>
<li>The <code>IClipboardSupport</code> interface should be implemented by EMF meta-model providers to inject meta-model
specific semantics into copy/paste operations. This interface has hints (e.g., what to do when pasted
elements collide, what related elements should always be copied together, etc.) that helps the framework
to make decisions. For maximal flexibility, it is even possible to override the paste operation altogether.
Where this interface is not sufficient to control copy/paste behavior, the specialization of the following
classes is permitted to define custom copy and paste operations:
<ul>
<li>The <code>OverrideCopyOperation</code> for special copying behavior. This class inherits a number of useful operations
from the <code>CopyOperation</code> class to find out about the objects that the user selected for copying,
additional objects required my the <code>IClipboardSupport</code>, and the relationships between them.
It also has methods for adding elements to be copied </li>
<li>The <code>OverridePasteChildOperation</code> for special pasting behavior. This class inherits a wealth of useful
operations from the <code>PasteChildOperation</code> class to find out about the objects that the user selected
for copying, additional objects required by the <code>IClipboardSupport</code>, and the relationships between them.
It also has methods to find which elements have failed to paste, to paste additional
elements (including handling paste collisions), etc.</li></li>
</ul>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Using the above classes follow the steps described below to provide clipboard support.
<ol>
<li>Create an extension for clipboardSupport extension point. Provide an implementation of the 
<code>IClipboardSupportFactory</code> interface and a specialization of the <code>AbstractClipboardSupport</code> class</li>
<li>Provide specialization of the <code>OverrideCopyOperation</code> or the <code>OverridePasteChildOperation</code> class for special behaviour</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="validationFramework"></a>How to use the validation framework</h2>
<p class="backto"><font size="-1">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</font></p>

<p>
The validation framework provides support for constraint providers for any EMF meta-model (batch and live constraints),
customizable model traversal algorithms, constraint parsing for languages, configurable constraint bindings to
application contexts and validation listeners. The following are the main extension points and classes to be used with
the validation framework.
<ol>
<li>The extension point <a href="../../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_emf_validation_constraintProviders.html">org.eclipse.emf.validation.constraintProviders</a> is used to provide constraints. Static
constraint providers declare constraints in the plugin.xml. Constraints are grouped into hierarchically structured
categories. Constraint providers target one or more EPackages by namespace URI. A group of constraints declares
categories in which they are members. Each constraint has a variety of meta-data associated with it (
Language, ID, severity, mode, name, message, triggers, etc.). Dynamic constraint providers address situations where
constraints cannot be declared statically. e.g., where constraints are defined in models or other resources. Dynamic
providers declare a class implementing the <code>IModelConstraintProvider</code> interface. This class is responsible
for making constraints available on the appropriate triggers, organizing them into categories, etc.</li>
<li>The extension point <a href="../../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_emf_validation_traversal.html">org.eclipse.emf.validation.traversal</a> is used to provide
customizable model traversal algorithms. Batch validation traverses a subset of the model starting from the user’s
selections. No traversal is performed in live validation. Some meta-models require custom strategies for traversal. The
default strategy simply iterates the content tree via <code>eAllContents()</code> API. Some meta-models do not use EMF containment
relationships extensively, or implement logical models on multiple distinct resources, making containment-based
traversal impractical.</li>
<li>The extension point <a href="../../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_emf_validation_constraintParsers.html">org.eclipse.emf.validation.constraintParsers</a> is used to provide
constraint parsing for languages. The validation framework provides support for two languages: Java and OCL. Clients can
provide support for other constraint languages via constraint parsers. The <code>Language ID</code>:  used in the <code>lang</code>
attribute of constraint elements in the constraint XML. The <code>Class</code>:  identifies an implementation of the 
<code>IXmlConstraintParser</code> interface, which constructs a constraint from the XML configuration data. Constraint
parsers are responsible for parsing the content of a constraint element in the plugin.xml to produce <code>IModelConstraint</code>
objects.</li>
<li>The extension point <a href="../../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_emf_validation_constraintBindings.html">org.eclipse.emf.validation.constraintBindings</a>
allows clients of the EMF Validation framework to define "client contexts" that describe the objects that they are
interested in validating, and to bind them to constraints that they are interested in enforcing on these objects.
A client context can declare an <code>enablement</code> expression that matches model elements that are included in the context. Where
that is not sufficient, an alternative is to define a selector class using a <code>selector</code> element. Client
contexts can be bound to constraints, individually, or to constraint categories (to bind all of the constraints in the
category). Binding to constraint categories has the advantage of allowing new constraint contributions in a category
to automatically be bound to the appropriate client context, even if the constraint is defined in a plug-in that
is unaware of that context or its binding to the category. Category bindings are inherited by sub-categories from their
ancestors.</li>
<li>The extension point <a href="../../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_emf_validation_validationListeners.html">org.eclipse.emf.validation.validationListeners</a>
is used to define validation listeners for the validation service (<code>org.eclipse.emf.validation.service.ModelValidationService</code>).
The validation service will inform this listener whenever validation has occurred, loading it if necessary in order to do so.
This is most useful for cases where client plug-ins need to find out about validation events even before they are loaded.
Otherwise, it is usually simpler just to programmatically add a listener to the validation service. The value of the
<code>listener</code> element class attribute must be the fully qualified name of a class that implements the
<code>IValidationListener</code> interface. Listeners can also be registered in code, at run-time, using the
<code>ModelValidationService.addValidationListener()</code> method.</li>
<li>The <code>ModelValidationService</code> singleton coordinates the invocation of validation. It defines a single factory
method for creation of <code>IValidator</code> for the batch and live evaluation modes. Validators validate one or more
objects at a time; the kind of object accepted as input depends on the evaluation mode. They can be configured to
report constraint passes as well as failures, for verbose results. Results are reported as <code>IValidationStatus</code>.
Validators can be reused by a client for any number of validation operations. The <code>ILiveValidator</code> validates
EMF <code>Notifications</code>. The <code>IBatchValidator</code> validates <code>EObjects</code> and, due to its support
for model traversal, supports progress monitors. Registered traversal strategies can be overridden by the client.</li>
<li>Clients can create an <code><a href="/help/topic/org.eclipse.emf.doc/references/javadoc/org/eclipse/emf/ecore/EValidator.html">EValidator</a></code>
implementation that delegates to the validation framework.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="oclFramework"></a>How to use the OCL framework</h2>
<p class="backto"><font size="-1">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</font></p>

<p>
The OCL framework provides the basic infrastructure for OCL constraint parsing and content assist for user models,
OCL constraint validation and specifying OCL queries and conditions. The following are the
main classes to be used with this framework:

<ol>
<li>OCL expressions are used for constructing, validating, and evaluating OCL queries and constraints on EMF model elements.
The <code>QueryFactory</code> class will creates instances of the <code>Query</code> class. The syntax of the queries is implemented by the
<code>OclExpression</code> class. For walking an OCL expression AST, see the <code>Visitor</code> interface.</li>
<li>The framework provides implementation of an XML constraint parser (<code>org.eclipse.emf.validation.xml.IXmlConstraintParser</code>) API
that supports definition of XML constraints in OCL. The class <code>OclConstraintParser</code> is the constraint parser
implementation that creates instances of the <code>OclModelConstraint</code> class, the OCL-language constraint implementation,
from XML constraint descriptors. It uses the <code>Query</code> class to test model elements against an OCL constraint expression.</li>
<li>The framework provides support for OCL syntax completion and parsing on the meta-model and user model level. The primary
interface is the <code>IOclHelper</code>, which provides OCL syntax completion assistance and parsing support. Instances of this
interface are obtained from the <code>HelperUtil</code> class. OCL code completion suggestions are represented as <code>Choice</code> instances,
which indicate the text of a language construct, a description, and the type of construct (<code>ChoiceType</code>).</li>
<li>The framework provides OCL extensions to the EMF Query framework. It defines the interface <code>IOclQueryHelper</code> for performing
OCL queries on EMF models. It supports Boolean-valued OCL expressions as query conditions that are used to formulate OCL
queries over EMF models. The class <code>OclCondition</code> applies OCL expressions to <code>EObjects</code>. Allows the
integration of OCL expressions with other <code>EObjectConditions</code>. </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="modelMgmtFramework"></a>How to use the model management framework</h2>
<p class="backto"><font size="-1">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</font></p>

<p>
The model management framework provides support for the following capabilities:
<ol>
<li>Unified Transaction Semantics</li>
<li>Undo/Redo management</li>
<li>Multi-threaded access control</li>
<li>Logical or composite resources</li>
<li>Batch notification of events</li>
<li>Evaluation of live constraints</li>
<li>Common read and write operations</li>
<li>Common re-usable commands</li>
<li>Path map support</li>
<li>Object life cycle management (destroy)</li>
<li>Centralized model for event notification</li>
<li>Event listeners with filters</li>
<li>Support for semantic procedures</li>
<li>Support for post processing after loading resources</li>
<li>Support for adapting (user) models to an equivalent Ecore representation.
Applies to those EMF meta-models that model classifiers in a run-time system</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The following are the main extension points and classes to be used with this framework:
<ol>
<li><b>Unified Transaction Semantics</b>: The class <code>MEditingDomain</code> exposes an editing domain that manages the
EMF based models in the modeling platform. This class integrates some of the core capabilities like model access, batched
notifications, multi-threaded access control and evaluation of live constraints in its <code>run..</code> methods.
This class is the main entry point. Clients would invoke the <code>createNewDomain</code> method to create a new instance
of the editing domain with its own undo stack and resource set. The class <code>MUndoInterval</code> is used to track
group changes to the model. The class <code>MEditingDomain</code> maintains its own undo stack. The undo stack is a
collection of <code>MUndoInterval</code> instances. The class <code>AbstractModelCommand</code> is the abstract parent
of all concrete commands that perform model operations. Clients must provide a definition of the <code>doExecute()</code>
method to perform some operation. All model commands have an associated undo interval, through which they can be undone
or redone.</li>
<li><b>Logical resource support</b>: The extension point <a href="../../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_gmf_runtime_emf_core_resourcePolicies.html">org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.resourcePolicies</a> is defined for
EMF meta-model providers to provide policies that customize the resource structure for their models.  The <code>ILogicalResource</code>
interface provides a logical view in memory of a tree structure that is persisted in multiple physical resources.
Metamodel-specific customizations are provided as <code>ILogicalResourcePolicy</code> implementations that define
the locations in a logical structure where boundaries in the physical structure are permitted and provide automatic
naming of physical resources.  <code>EFactory</code> implementations registered on this extension point provide support
for incremental loading of logical resources.</li>
<li><b>Path map support</b>: The extension point <a href="../../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_gmf_runtime_emf_core_Pathmaps.html">org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.Pathmaps</a> is defined for path map
variables. Path map variables allow for portability of URIs, similar to Eclipse's core path variables. The actual location
indicated by a URI depends on the run-time binding of the path variable. Thus, different environments can work with the
same resource URIs even though the resources are stored in different physical locations. Path map support is integrated
into the <code>MEditingDomain</code> class.</li>
<li><b>Object life cycle management</b>: The <code>EObjectUtil</code> class has a destroy method that destroys the object by
removing it from its container and severing all references from and to the object. It is also recursive, i.e., it gets
called on the children. The class <code>MetaModelUtil</code> provides utility functions that work at the meta-class level.
The class <code>ProxyUtil</code> class contains a set of utility methods that control the use of Proxy objects.
Additional information like the qualified name of the referenced object in-case of cross-resource references is stored
with the proxy using a proprietary format. The class <code>EObjectContainmentUtil</code> provides utilities for analysis
of the containment and relationships type-conformance relationships between <code>EObjects</code>.</li>
<li><b>Listeners and Filters</b>: The class <code>MListener</code> is used handle EMF events. To define a new listener, one
would subclass this class and implement the abstract method <code>onEvent</code>. A listener can have only one filter
associated with it. For the listener to start listening, one must attach a filter to the listener and call <code>startListening</code>.
The class <code>MFilter</code> is used to control what events get sent to listeners. To define a new filter, one would
subclass this class and implement the abstract method <code>matches</code>. This class also defines some pre-defined
filters that can be composed to build more complex filters. Some of these are filter instances, some are classes. The
listeners are associated with a editing domain. The <code>IDemuxedMListener</code> interface can be implemented by
clients interested in individual resource and object lifecycle events. The <code>DemuxingMListener</code> class is a
demultiplexing event listener, which relays batched events from the <code>MListener</code> protocol one at a time,
dispatching them to the appropriate methods of an <code>IDemuxedMListener</code> according to the nature of each event.
Some of the custom event types supported are
<ul>
  <li><code>EventTypes.CREATE</code>, <code>EventTypes.DESTROY</code></li>
  <li><code>EventTypes.IMPORT</code>, <code>EventTypes.EXPORT</code></li>
  <li><code>EventTypes.UNRESOLVE</code></li>
  <li><code>EventTypes.SEPARATE</code>, <code>EventTypes.ABSORB</code>, <code>EventTypes.LOAD</code></li></ul></li>
<li><b>Meta-model Support</b>: The extension point <a href="../../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_gmf_runtime_emf_core_MetaModelProviders.html">org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core. MetaModelProviders</a> allows 
clients to provide meta-model support services. Providers implement the interface <code>IMetamodelSupportProvider</code>.
The implementation of the interface method <code>getMetamodelSupport</code> returns the <code>IMetamodelSupport</code> object.
The service gives all interested providers a chance to create meta-model support objects for the given <code>EPackage</code> in
order of priority from lowest to highest. The service is very useful for supporting semantic procedures
and post processing after loading resources. The methods to implement in the <code>IMetamodelSupport</code>
interface are <code>handleEvent</code> and <code>postProcess</code>.</li>
</ol>
