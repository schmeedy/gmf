<h2>Model Management Example</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This example describes the usage of model management framework within the SDK.
It demonstrates some of the model management capabilities (editing domain, validation,
batched notification, semantic procedures etc.) applied to library models.
</p>

<h3>References</h3>
<p>
Please refer to the document <a href="exampleOverview.html">Model Services Layer Examples Overview</a>
for reviewing the library meta-model used as the basis for demonstrating the capabilities in this example.
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This example plug-in is named <code>org.eclipse.gmf.examples.runtime.emf</code>. This plugin registers
an editor <b>MSL Library Model Editor</b> to manage the library models. The library models can be opened using the
defualt library editor or this editor. The <b>MSL Library Model Editor</b> demonstrates the integrated capabilities
of the model management framework.

<p>
This plug-in contributes the <b>MSL</b> menu to the MSL library editor's main menu and context menu.
The menu has the following actions:
<ol>
<li><b>Edit:</b> Allows to edit the properties of a library model element. The changes made will be
committed as a whole or can be undone as a whole (demonstrates the concept of an <code>MUndoInterval</code>)</li>
<li><b>Create Resource:</b> Creates a library resource</li>
<li><b>Load Resource:</b> Loads a library resource</li>
<li><b>Unload Resource:</b> Unloads a library resource</li>
<li><b>Set Pathmap:</b> Allows to create a pathmap variable and set its value. The path map entry gets added to the
URI map within the <code>URIConverter</code></li>
<li><b>Display All MSL Events:</b> Displays all the batched events received in the console</li>
<li><b>Validate Elements:</b> Triggers batch validation</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>In addition to the above mentioned actions, the editor also has actions to add books and writers. They are
<b>NewChild->Books</b> and <b>NewChild->Writers</b>. These actions allow creation of multiple books and writers respectively.
This capability demonstrates the grouped changes to the model within an <code>MUndoInterval</code>. The semantic procedure
implemented in this example ensures that unique names are assigned to the books and writers. The editor also has
actions to <b>Undo</b>, <b>Redo</b> and <b>Delete</b> changes to the model.</p>

<p>Please refer to the tutorial <a href="../../tutorials/msl/modelManagementTutorial.html">Model Management Tutorial</a> 
for reviewing the code samples within this example</p>
