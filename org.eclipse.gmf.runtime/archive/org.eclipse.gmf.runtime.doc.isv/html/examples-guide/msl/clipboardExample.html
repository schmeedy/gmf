<h2>Clipboard Example</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This example describes the usage of the clipboard framework within the SDK.
It demonstrates how to copy and paste library model elements to and from the system clipboard respectively.
</p>

<h3>References</h3>
<p>
Please refer to the document <a href="exampleOverview.html">Model Services Layer Examples Overview</a>
for reviewing the library meta-model used as the basis for demonstrating the capabilities in this example.
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This example plug-in is named <code>org.eclipse.gmf.examples.runtime.emf.clipboard</code>.
This plug-in contributes the <b>Clipboard</b> menu to the library
editor's main menu and context menu. The menu has two actions:
<ol><li><b>Copy:</b> 
Supports rich copy support for books and writers. A writer's books are always copied when the writer is copied</li>
<li><b>Paste:</b> Pasting a writer into a library that already has a writer of the same name merges the pasted
writer into the existing one (most notably, adding to its books). <b>Undo/Redo</b> support for the paste operation uses
the EMF <code>ChangeRecorder</code> API</li></ol>
</p>

<p>Please refer to the tutorial <a href="../../tutorials/msl/clipboardTutorial.html">Clipboard Tutorial</a> 
for reviewing the code samples within this example</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
Refer to this example if you need:
<ol>
<li>
To implement fairly complex meta-model specific semantics for copy/paste operations,
where some relationships between model elements need special treatment</li>
</ol>
