<h2>Model Services Layer Examples Overview</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The model services layer within the Graphical Modeling Framework has examples associated with
the different functional components like Validation, Query, Model Management, Clipboard etc. All
these examples use the library meta-model as the basis for demonstrating the capabilities. The intent
of using the library meta-model is to help the user understand the capabilities applied to a simpler
domain. This is the same meta-model used by the EMF team to demonstrate the EMF capabilities.
The meta-model being used looks like the following in UML.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
All the generated plugins related to the library model are installed automatically
as part of the individual examples. The generated editor for the library model supports
multi-rooted libraries. Most of the examples contribute menu items to the main menu and
the context menu of the library editor to demonstrate their respective capabilities.
</p>

<h3>Installing and running the examples</h3>
<p>
Follow the <a href="../samples.html">Installation of the examples</a> 
instructions to install the examples in the workspace. Running the examples typically
involves:
<ol>
<li>
Starting a runtime workbench</li>
<li>
Create library models</li>
<li>
Use the menu items within the main menu or the context menu of the library editor
to test capabilities</li>
</ol>
