<h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

<p class="backto"><font size="-1">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</font></p>

<p>
The Model Service Layer (MSL) provides a number of facilities to ease model management:
model modification semantics, uniform resource creation and loading, uniform listener
registration, batching of notifications, live validation with automatic modification
abandonment, copy/paste support, automated pathmap support and additional metamodel support.
The inclusion of all of these features in one manageable infrastructure adds many unique
advantages to an application.
</p>

<h2><a name="refs"></a>References</h2>

<p class="backto"><font size="-1">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</font></p>

<p>
This tutorial assumes that the reader is familiar with EMF and is familiar with the concept of
 metamodels. A crucial part of understanding EMF is being able to understand its reflective mechanisms
 including <code>EClasses,</code> <code>EStructuralFeatures</code> and <code>EPackages.</code> The reader
 should be familiar with EMF extension parsers, EMF Resources and the general mechanism for resolving 
 URIs to resources and to specific EObjects in those resources.
</p>
<p>
For reference, the full <A HREF="../../examples-guide/msl/modelManagementExample.html">example</A> for this tutorial is available.
</p>

<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p class="backto"><font size="-1">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</font></p>

<p>
We will be making use of the RMP Library metamodel extensively to provide examples of how the
MSL facilities can be used and/or have functionality provided to the layer.
</p>
<p>
For those readers who are not familiar with this metamodel, it models a library with books and writers.
The most important aspect of the library metamodel for this tutorial is the fact that books are modeled
as EObjects whose EClass is <code>Book</code> and they contain a EStructuralFeature called <code>pages</code>
that stores an integer number of pages contained in the book. There are also <code>Libraries</code> and
that can contain <code>Writers</code> as well as books.
</p>

<h2><a name="editing_domain"></a>Creating and Using an MSL Editing Domain</h2>

<p class="backto"><font size="-1">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</font></p>

<p>
An <a href="../../reference/api/common/org/eclipse/gmf/runtime/emf/core/edit/MEditingDomain.html">MEditingDomain</a> is the entry point to any usage of the MSL. An editing domain
provides an EMF resource set, which contains all of the EObjects that are going to be
managed using the MSL.
<p>

<pre class="snippet">
// Create the editing domain
editingDomain = MEditingDomain.createNewDomain();
</pre>

<p>It is suggested that any resource that is contained within
an MSL resource set be an instance provided by the <a href="../../reference/api/common/org/eclipse/gmf/runtime/emf/core/resources/MResourceFactory.html">MResourceFactory</a>. Therefore,
we must associate our file extensions(.rmplibrary) with the MResourceFactory in a extension 
parser plugin extension:
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
   &lt;extension
         point=&quot;org.eclipse.emf.ecore.extension_parser&quot;&gt;
      &lt;parser
            type=&quot;rmplibrary&quot;
            class=&quot;org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.resources.MResourceFactory&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/parser&gt;
   &lt;/extension&gt;
</pre>

<p>
MSL resources will use UUIDs (Universally Unique IDs) for URIs for all of their EObjects
to help keep track of the movement of EObjects within a resource. As well, MSL resources
use specific EMF loading/saving options that are optimal for many use cases.
</p>

<p>
Having registered the MSL resource factory against the &quot;rmplibrary&quot; file extension,
we can now create and load resources with that file extension:
</p>

<a name="create_resource"></a>
<pre class="snippet">
Resource r1 = 
	editingDomain.createResource("file://c:/eclipse/workspace/aProject/test.rmplibrary", 
					RMPLibraryPackage.eINSTANCE.getLibrary());
Resource r2 = 
	editingDomain.loadResource("file://c:/eclipse/workspace/aProject/test2.rmplibrary");
</pre>

<h2><a name="making_changes"></a>Making Changes to Resources</h2>

<p class="backto"><font size="-1">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</font></p>

<p>
Once resources are loaded, or created, they are subject to the MSL protocol. The protocol
states that no modifications can be made unless an appropriate undo interval is open and
a write action is started. This protocol is enforced and failure to adhere to the protocol
will throw an <code>MSLActionProtocolException</code>. The clear advantage to this approach 
is that specific undo intervals can be undone/redone without the necessity of constructing
static commands that must be composed to perform a modification. Also, the write actions can
be validated and possibly abandoned (elaborated in the Model Validation section below) if they
do not adhere to the live validation constraints.
</p>

<p>
The MSL protocol also states that any reads should be made in a read action. This part of the
protocol is not enforced but it is recommended that this requirement be honored in order to
satisfy forwards compatibility.
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
final Library l = (Library)r1.getContents().get(0);

MUndoInterval interval = 
	editingDomain.runInUndoInterval("Setting the library name",new Runnable() {
		public void run() {
			try {
				editingDomain.runAsWrite(new MRunnable() {
					public Object run() {
						l.setName("Kanata Public Library");
						return null;
					}
				});
			} catch (MSLActionAbandonedException e) {
				System.err.println("Error: MSL action abandoned due to the following exception:");
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		}
	});
</pre>

<p>
Of course, once the undo interval and writer actions are opened, the inner MRunnable object's
run method can make calls to any other methods and make modifications any of the EObjects 
in the editing domain. The undo interval object that is returned can be used at any time to
undo/redo all of the modifications made during the interval:
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
interval.undo(); // All changes are now undone
interval.redo(); // All changes are now redone
</pre>

<p>
If undo interval number 1 is created and undo interval number 2 is subsequently created,
undoing number 1 will automatically undo number 2 first. MSL maintains a proper stack
to ensure the editing domain's integrity.
</p>

<p>
Now that we have made changes to the r1, the resource will be dirty and we must save the
changes back to the file:
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
editingDomain.saveResource(r1);
</pre>

<h2><a name="listeners"></a>MSL Listeners</h2>

<p class="backto"><font size="-1">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</font></p>

<p>
MSL has a different approach to listening than standard EMF. Standard EMF adapters
can be used, they are referred to as &quot;immediate&quot; listeners. The MSL protocol has enabled
it to produce &quot;batched&quot; notifications meaning that all notifications produced during
a write action are batched together until the end when it is given to listeners as a list. This
enables listeners to be able to get more information at once and helps to prevent the need for
much stateful information to be kept in the listener. A simple listener can be registered as follows:
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
dirtyListener = new MListener(editingDomain,
	MFilter.RESOURCE_DIRTIED_FILTER) {

	public void onEvent(List events) {
		System.out.println("A resource has been dirtied.");
	}
};
dirtyListener.startListening();
</pre>

<p>
Ensure that the listener object is being referenced by some object other than the editing domain.
The editing domain keeps listeners using weak reference collections so it is possible that the
listener could get garbage collected and produce intermittent results. The filter option is
an added benefit to the MSL listener approach. It allows the listener to filter conveniently for
common types of notification occurrences.
</p>

<h2 ><a name="validation"></a>Model Validation</h2>

<p class="backto"><font size="-1">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</font></p>

<p>
As mentioned above, the EMF validation framework forms an integral part of the action protocol
of MSL. Whenever a write action is opened, the client must catch an <a href="../../reference/api/common/org/eclipse/gmf/runtime/emf/core/exceptions/MSLActionAbandonedException.html">MSLActionAbandonedException</a>
in case the modifications violated a live validation constraint. In this case, all modifications in
the write action are undone. In order to contribute live validation constraints, read the tutorial
on <a href="validationTutorial.html">EMF Validation.</a> The MSL does not explicitly define its
own validation client context. It is up to the client of the MSL to declare their own client contexts
and context binding in order to hook up their own validation.
</p>

<p>
Batch validation can be performed in a similar fashion as mentioned in the validation tutorial.
The only difference is that a batch validation should be performed in a read action of the
editing domain to ensure forward compatibility with later versions of MSL.
</p>

<h2><a name="copy_paste"></a>MSL Copy and Paste Support</h2>

<p class="backto"><font size="-1">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</font></p>

<p>
Copy and paste functionality is available directly through the EMF Clipboard support. See the
<a href="clipboardTutorial.html">tutorial</a> for more details about how to contribute clipboard
support to the RMP library metamodel. Clients of the clipboard support using MSL must open a
read action using the editing domain to perform a copy operation and a write action to perform a 
paste operation. It is not necessary to register another extension parser for clipboard support
because the MResourceFactory registered above will make use of UUIDs(Universally Unique IDs), which
satisfies the EMF Clipboard requirement.
</p>

<h2><a name="pathmaps"></a>Pathmaps</h2>

<p class="backto"><font size="-1">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</font></p>

<p>
Pathmaps allow us to make inter-resource references when the URIs of resources may change. Without
the use of pathmaps, moving resources around on the filesystem or in the eclipse workspace could
prevent EMF from resolving the URIs.
</p>

<p>
The way that pathmaps work is to allow resources' URIs to be defined in terms of a pathmap. Whenever 
resources move around on the filesystem, the pathmap can be updated to point to the new location 
and allow the inter-resources references to that resource to be resolved. The following code illustrates
the benefit of pathmaps:
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
Resource r3 = editingDomain.createResource("file://c:/eclipse/workspace/test/test2.rmplibrary");
Resource r4 = editingDomain.createResource("file://c:/eclipse/workspace/test/test3.rmplibrary");

// Add content to r3 and r4
// r4 has a reference to r3 because one of the writers has written a book that is contained in r3

editingDomain.saveResource(r3);
editingDomain.saveResource(r4);

editingDomain.unloadResource(r3);
editingDomain.unloadResource(r4);

// User renames 'test' project to 'MSL Tests'

r3 = editingDomain.loadResource("file://c:/eclipse/workspace/MSL Tests/test2.rmplibrary");
r4 = editingDomain.loadResource("file://c:/eclipse/workspace/MSL Tests/test3.rmplibrary");
// BOOM! The writer in r4 has a broken reference to a book that it has written because
//  the URI was stored using the "file://" URI
</pre>

<p>
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
editingDomain.setPathVariable("TEST_PLUGIN","file://c:/eclipse/workspace/test);
Resource r3 = editingDomain.createResource("pathmap://TEST_PLUGIN/test2.rmplibrary");
Resource r4 = editingDomain.createResource("pathmap://TEST_PLUGIN/test3.rmplibrary");

// Add content to r3 and r4
// r4 has a reference to r3 because one of the writers has written a book that is contained in r3

editingDomain.saveResource(r3);
editingDomain.saveResource(r4);

editingDomain.unloadResource(r3);
editingDomain.unloadResource(r4);

// User renames 'test' project to 'MSL Tests'
editingDomain.setPathVariable("TEST_PLUGIN","file://c:/eclipse/workspace/MSL Tests");

r3 = editingDomain.loadResource("pathmap://TEST_PLUGIN/test2.rmplibrary");
r4 = editingDomain.loadResource("pathmap://TEST_PLUGIN/test3.rmplibrary");
// The writer's reference is fully restored to the book that it wrote in r3
</pre>

<p>
Pathmaps can be registered using an extension to allow resources to be loaded from a plugin.
Since plugins will be in different locations depending on the location of the
user's eclipse installation pathmaps fill this niche perfectly:
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
  &lt;extension
        point=&quot;org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.Pathmaps&quot;&gt;
     &lt;pathmap
           path=&quot;libraries&quot;
           name=&quot;CORE_LIBRARIES&quot;
           plugin=&quot;org.eclipse.gmf.examples.runtime.emf&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/extension&gt;
</pre>

<p>
This extension will be used later in this tutorial to allow the unique library of congress
resource to be loaded directly from the example plugin in its libraries folder.
</p>

<h2><a name="metamodel_support"></a>MSL Metamodel Support</h2>

<p class="backto"><font size="-1">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</font></p>

<p>
The metamodel support extension allows clients to contribute behaviour that is not directly
expressed in the EMF metamodel into their MSL environment. For example, there may be an EReference
defined in the metamodel that allows any EObject of any specialization of a particular
EClass to be contained within the EReference. The metamodel writers may wish to provide further
granularity to the exact EClasses that may be contained. Perhaps it doesn't make sense in certain
cases for instances of one EClass to be contained within another EClass. Metamodel support can
contribute what is called &quot;semantic procedures&quot; such as automatic naming to new
EObjects of that metamodel. Finally, metamodel support can be used to load certain &quot;library&quot;
resources that contribute content that is commonly referenced by user resources. We will contribute
the following metamodel support for the RMP Library metamodel in MSL:
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
public class LibraryMetaModel
	implements IMetamodelSupport {

	private static final String CORE_LIBRARIES_PATHMAP = "CORE_LIBRARIES"; //$NON-NLS-1$

			if (event.getEventType() == Notification.ADD) {
				autoName((EObject)event.getNotifier(), (EReference)event.getFeature(), (EObject)event.getNewValue());
			} else if (event.getEventType() == Notification.ADD_MANY) {
				autoName((EObject)event.getNotifier(), (EReference)event.getFeature(), (Collection)event.getNewValue());
			}
		}
	}
	
	private void setName(EObject eObj, String name) {
		EClass eCls = eObj.eClass();
		
		if (eCls == RMPLibraryPackage.eINSTANCE.getLibrary()) {
			((Library)eObj).setName(name);
		} else if (eCls == RMPLibraryPackage.eINSTANCE.getBook()) {

		} else if (eCls == RMPLibraryPackage.eINSTANCE.getWriter()) {
			((Writer)eObj).setName(name);
		}
	}
	
	private String getName(EObject eObj) {
		if (eObj.eClass() == RMPLibraryPackage.eINSTANCE.getBook()) {
			return ((Book)eObj).getTitle();

		}
	}
	
	/**

	 */
	private void autoName(EObject container, EReference reference,

				String name = getName((EObject)i.next());
				if (name == null)
					continue;
				int number = extractNumeric(eObject.eClass().getName(),name);
				if ( number &gt;= max) {
					max = number+1;
				}
			}
			
			setName(eObject, eObject.eClass().getName() + max);
		} else {
			setName(eObject, eObject.eClass().getName());
		}
	}

	private int extractNumeric(String prefix, String fullName) {
		if (fullName.startsWith(prefix)) {
			String suffix = fullName.substring(prefix.length(),fullName.length());
			if (suffix.length() &gt; 0) {
				try {
					return Integer.parseInt(suffix);
				} catch (NumberFormatException e) {
					// Do nothing, fall out and return 1;
				}
			} 
		}
		
		return 0;
	}

	/**

	 */
	private void autoName(EObject container, EReference reference,
			Collection objects) {

		for (Iterator i = objects.iterator(); i.hasNext();) {

			Object object = i.next();

			if (object instanceof EObject) {

				EObject eObject = (EObject) object;

				autoName(container, reference, eObject);
			}
		}
	}

	/*

	public void postProcess(final EObject root) {
		// The library of congress will always exist
		//  and its model should always be in the resource set.

				URI.createURI("pathmap://" + CORE_LIBRARIES_PATHMAP + "/" + "LibraryOfCongress.rmplibrary"), true); //$NON-NLS-1$ //$NON-NLS-2$//$NON-NLS-3$
	}
}
</pre>

<p>
It is nice to have every writer and book automatically given a new unique name whenever
someone adds them to a library. Also, the library of congress is loaded as a post-process
whenever a resource is loaded. The library of congress contains some static content that
all users of the library metamodel in MSL would like to have automatically loaded. Notice
that URI of the resource makes use of the plugin extension that we defined above. The library
of congress resource file is located in the libraries folder and deployed as part of our plugin.
There is no additional destroy and/or containment semantics that we wish to add using our
metamodel support. The extension and factory are defined with the following code and xml:
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
public class LibraryMetaModelProvider
	extends AbstractProvider
	implements IMetamodelSupportProvider {

	/* Attribute for the meta model support object */
	private IMetamodelSupport metaModelSupport = null;

	public IMetamodelSupport getMetamodelSupport(EPackage ePackage) {
		if (metaModelSupport == null) {
			metaModelSupport = new LibraryMetaModel();
		}

		return metaModelSupport;
	}

	public boolean provides(IOperation operation) {
		if (operation instanceof GetMetamodelSupportOperation) {
			GetMetamodelSupportOperation getMetaModelOperation = (GetMetamodelSupportOperation) operation;

			EPackage ePackage = getMetaModelOperation.getEPackage();

			return (ePackage == RMPLibraryPackage.eINSTANCE);
		}

		return false;
	}
}
</pre>
