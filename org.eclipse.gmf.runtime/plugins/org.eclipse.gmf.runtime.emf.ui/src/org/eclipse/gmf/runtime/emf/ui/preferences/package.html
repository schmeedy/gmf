Implementation of preference pages controlling the MSL UI plug-in's UI
interaction with the user.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
Clients may use the
{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.ui.preferences.ValidationLiveProblemsDestination}
class to determine the mode in which this plug-in reports live validation problems,
to better determine their own reporting requirements.  For example, if MSL UI
already shows a dialog, then clients can avoid showing another (redundant) dialog
themselves.
