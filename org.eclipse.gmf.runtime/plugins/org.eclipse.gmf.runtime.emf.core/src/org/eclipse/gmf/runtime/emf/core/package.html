Modeling Services Layer (MSL). This package exposes classes and interfaces to manage Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) models.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
This package fulfills two roles:
<ul>
<li>Exposes the necessary API to access and modify EMF-based models through {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.EditingDomain EditingDomain}</li>
<li>Exposes helpers to manage individual {@link org.eclipse.emf.ecore.EObject EObject}s through {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.IEObjectHelper IEObjectHelper}</li>
</ul>
<h3>EMF-Based Model Management</h3>
{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.EditingDomain EditingDomain} is the central class that manages the EMF-based models 
that are manipulated by tools that are built on the modeling platform.

<h4>Model Access</h4>


EMF-based models typically persist in {@link org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.Resource Resource}s. Each Resource that the EditingDomain manages is a member of the domain's
{@link org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.ResourceSet ResourceSet}. The ResourceSet is accessible from {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.EditingDomain#getResourceSet EditingDomain.getResourceSet}.

<p>
To ensure proper concurrency support and notification batching, the EditingDomain must supervise access to and modification of models that are members of the EditingDomain's ResourceSet.
Model access and modifications are implemented in {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.ResourceSetOperation ResourceSetOperation}s. To read or modify models, a client passes a 
{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.ResourceSetReadOperation ResourceSetReadOperation} or a {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.ResourceSetModifyOperation ResourceSetModifyOperation} to
{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.EditingDomain#run EditingDomain.run}, respectively.
</p>
<p>
The following example illustrates model read access:
<pre>
	editingDomain.run( new ResourceSetReadOperation() {

		protected void execute(IProgressMonitor monitor)
			throws InvocationTargetException, InterruptedException {
			
			// Insert code to read the editing domain's models here
			...
		}
	}, new NullProgressMonitor());
</pre>
</p>
The code that performs the read access is guaranteed that every model in the ResourceSet
will remain unchanged for the duration of the operation.
<p>
The following example illustrates model modification access:
<pre>
	editingDomain.run( new ResourceSetModifyOperation("MyOperationTitle") {

		protected void execute(IProgressMonitor monitor)
			throws InvocationTargetException, InterruptedException {
			
			// Insert code to modify the editing domain's models here
			...
		}
	}, new NullProgressMonitor());
</pre>
</p>
The code that modifies the model has exclusive access to every model
in the ResourceSet for the duration of the operation. The modeling platform automatically provides undo and redo support 
for any model modification that the operation performs. The title that is 
passed to ResourceSetModifyOperation appears on the <b>Edit > Undo &lt;</b><i>title</i><b>&gt;</b> and
<b>Edit > Redo &lt;</b><i>title</i><b>&gt;</b> menus.


<h4>Notifications</h4>

The EditingDomain batches the notifications that operations issue. To receive these notifications, a client should register and
unregister {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.OperationListener OperationListener} through 
{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.EditingDomain#addOperationListener EditingDomain.addOperationListener} and 
{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.EditingDomain#removeOperationListener EditingDomain.removeOperationListener} 
respectively.
<p>
An OperationListener is notified in three situations:
<ul>
<li>When an operation is done, {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.OperationListener#done OperationListener.done} is called</li>
<li>When an operation is undone, {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.OperationListener#undone OperationListener.undone} is called</li>
<li>When an operation is redone, {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.OperationListener#undone OperationListener.redone} is called</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each of these OperationListener methods receives an {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.IOperationEvent IOperationEvent} parameter. 
Listeners can receive the list of notifications that were batched during an operation through 
{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.IOperationEvent#getNotifications IOperationEvent.getNotifications}. Each
item in the returned list is an instance of {@link org.eclipse.emf.common.notify.Notification Notification} 
or one of its derived classes. {@link org.eclipse.emf.common.notify.Notification#getEventType Notification.getEventType} 
should be used to determine the exact nature of the change that this notification represents. 
{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.EventTypes EventTypes}. exposes possible event types.
</p>
<p>
For nested operations, notifications are sent only after the outermost operation is completed. 
</p>
<p>
If operations are executed from within an {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.OperationListener#done OperationListener.done} implementation,
the label that appears on the <b>Edit > Undo &lt;</b><i>title</i><b>&gt;</b> and
<b>Edit > Redo &lt;</b><i>title</i><b>&gt;</b> menus remains the title of the 
ResourceSetModifyOperation at the root of the event chain. The title of the operation that the
listener executes is not be used.
</p>
<p>
A ResourceSetModifyOperation should <b>NEVER</b> be executed from within implementations of 
{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.OperationListener#undone OperationListener.undone} or 
{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.OperationListener#redone OperationListener.redone}.
</p>
<p>
<em>
It is good practice to always assume that the title of a ResourceSetModifyOperation is used for user
consumption, because the modeling platform cannot guarantee IOperationEvents are only sent as the result
of a ResourceSetOperation. In this case, the title of the event listener's operation is used.
</em>
</p>
<p>
EObject, through its {@link org.eclipse.emf.common.notify.Notifier Notifier} implementation, exposes
an API to register listeners. This API should <b>NEVER</b> be used because the notifications that this
API sends are not batched. Consequently, listeners could access a model that is in an inconsistent
state, or could modify the model and break the contract with the running ResourceSetModifyOperation
that stipulates exclusive access to the resources of the ResourceSet.
</p>
<h3>EObject Management</h2>
{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.IEObjectHelper IEObjectHelper} is a helper interface for using 
{@link org.eclipse.emf.ecore.EObject EObject}s.
<p>
IEObjectHelper provides support for the following actions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Destroying EObject.</li>
<li>Retrieving information about non-resolved cross-model EObjects</li>
<li>Finding EObjects that reference a given EObject</li>
<li>Validating EObjects.</li>
</ul>
