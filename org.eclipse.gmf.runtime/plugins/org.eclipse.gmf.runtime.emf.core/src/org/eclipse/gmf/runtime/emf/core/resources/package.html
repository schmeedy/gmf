MSL resource API.  This package provides the MSL extension of
the EMF {@link org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.Resource} interface and the
resource factory responsible for creating MSL resources.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
The {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.resources.ILogicalResource} interface
is the abstract specification of an MSL resource, which is an XMI resource
that can be persisted in multiple files.  A "logical resource" is an in-memory
view of any number of discrete, interconnected "physical" XMI resources
comprising a single model tree (or forest, in the case of a logical resource
with multiple roots).
</p><p>
Within the logical view of a model, one or more elements
may be "separated" from its containing element in the physical view.  The
physical URI of a separate element is different from the physical URI of its
container.  However, for the purposes of referencing such elements from within
the logical resource or from another logical resource, these elements are both
addressed by the logical URI.  A logical resource has a single "root" resource
in the physical implementation, which serves to anchor the graph of separate
resources.  This root resource's URI defines the logical URI.
</p><p>
Providers of EMF metamodels can define policies that control how elements in
their metamodel may be separated from their containers.  An implementation of
the {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.resources.ILogicalResourcePolicy} is
registered on the
<tt><a href="../../../../../../../../../extension-points/com_ibm_xtools_emf_msl_core_resourcePolicies.html">org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.resourcePolicies</a></tt>
extension point.  The policy defines call-back methods to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>determine which elements in a resource are allowed to be separated</li>
  <li>suggest a URI for a new physical resource (to support auto-naming of files)</li>
  <li>perform edit-validation operations such as prompting to check out
      physical resources in a version-control system</li>
  <li>transform the model in some way when an element is separated or absorbed</li>
</ul>
<p>
The logical resource supports full and incremental loading of its physical units,
using special load options.  In the incremental loading case, units may be
loaded either explicitly by the client application or automatically.  Automatic
resolution will read unloaded elements from their physical resources as they
are traversed by accessing a containment reference or by resolution of reference
proxies.  To support the automatic loading of containment references, the
<tt>resourcePolicies</tt> extension point also allows a metamodel provider to
register an {@link org.eclipse.emf.ecore.EFactory} that creates elements using
special containment lists that load objects from separate units (such as the
{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.util.EObjectContainmentLoadingEList}).
</p><p>
This package also defines the
{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.resources.GMFResourceFactory} class that
creates MSL resources.  It is not intended to be used by client code, but to
be referenced on the EMF <tt>org.eclipse.emf.ecore.extension_parser</tt>
extension point to associate the client application's file extension with the
resource factory.
