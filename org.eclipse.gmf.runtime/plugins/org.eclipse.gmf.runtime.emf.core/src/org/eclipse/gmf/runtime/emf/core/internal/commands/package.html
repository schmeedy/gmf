The commands that implement the MSL undo/redo command stack.  These are used
internally by the MSL to implement undo/redo support in EMF models, and by
clients to inject undo/redo logic associated with model changes into the
MSL's command stack to coordinate related changes in some other non-EMF
data store.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
The core types in this API are:
<ul>
<li>{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.internal.commands.MCommand}:
     abstract specification of an MSL command, extending the EMF
     {@link org.eclipse.emf.common.command.Command} interface</li>
<li>{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.internal.commands.MSLUndoStack}:
     the undo/redo stack of <code>MCommand</code>s</li>
<li>{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.internal.commands.MSLAbstractCommand}:
     abstract partial implementation of the <code>MCommand</code> interface</li>
<li>{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.internal.commands.MSLCompoundCommand}:
     implements composition of <code>MCommand</code>s into single undoable
     units</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.internal.commands.MSLCommandGenerator}
is not a part of this package's API; it is used internally by the MSL to
populate the command stack in response to notifications from EMF.
