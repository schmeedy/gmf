<p>
This package contains the <i>edit part</i> classes and some related classes.
An edit part is a controller that specifies how model elements are mapped to visual figures and coordinates 
the editing behavior of the model.
</p>

<p>Classes in this package should only depend on the pure GEF editparts and related classes and could
conceivably be candidates for submission to the GEF project.</p>
