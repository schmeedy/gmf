<p>Provides a set of classes that implement a <code>Service</code> that
facilitates the contribution of actions to modeling platform workbench
parts. It is meant to address some of the deficiencies in the Eclipse
support for static action contributions, as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>adds support for static contribution of custom contribution items</li>

	<li>adds support for static menu contributions to toolbar managers</li>

	<li>adds support for static contributions to menu managers that have
	been added programmatically to a toolbar</li>

	<li>adds support for complex action enablement and visibility criteria</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to contribute contributions items to the service, clients
should use the <code>org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.common.ui.services.action.contributionItemProviders</code>
extension point. The provider implementation specified in the extension
point should subclass the {@link
org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.common.ui.services.action.contributionitem.AbstractContributionItemProvider}
class in this package.</p>

<p>Contributions made through this extension point could be for a workbench 
part's action bars (referred to as part contributions) or for a workbench 
part's popup menu (referred to as popup contributions). The extension point 
provides an XML description of those contributions to be read by the described 
providers. The extension point provides an alternative to the following Eclipse extension points:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>org.eclipse.ui.editorActions</LI>
<LI>org.eclipse.ui.viewActions</LI>
<LI>org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus (viewerContribution)</LI>
</UL>
