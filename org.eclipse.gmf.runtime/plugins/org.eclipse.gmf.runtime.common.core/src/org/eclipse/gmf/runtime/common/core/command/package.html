Provides a set of classes for executing, undoing and redoing units of
work, known as
<i>Commands</i>
. This API is an implementation of the Command design pattern. Using
this API, application operations can be done, undone, redone and
canceled without any dependency on UI components.
<p>The intent of the Command design pattern is to divide the
responsibility for performing application operations among different
objects. The Command object encapsulates the knowledge to perform an
operation, as well as the knowledge to undo and redo that operation. It
is different from the object that makes the request to perform the
operation.</p>

<p>Modeling platform command implementations should subclass the {@link
org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.common.core.command.AbstractCommand} class in
this package. Two or more commands can be composed together into a
single {@link
org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.common.core.command.CompositeCommand}, which can
be undone and redone in a single step.</p>

<p>Commands should be executed, undone and redone through an instance of
the {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.common.core.command.CommandManager}
class. The command manager will maintain a history of the commands that
it has executed that are eligible to be undone and redone.</p>
